			<h1>THE TREATMENT AND ROLE OF WOMEN IN THE NOVEL AND SOCIETY TODAY </h1>
		</div>
		<div class="box-1">

		<p>Women are afflicted which allows them to be controlled by men we see these through Maame men control the fate of maame and her two daughters that is Effie and Esi.maame was being rapped as a house girl before escaping to her old village. Esi is captured by white and African men and put in the dungeon with other women ready to be sold while today Women are now found in occupations, industries and roles previously regarded as the sole prerogative of men.</p>

		<p>For women characters in the book  the opposite assumption is made; the oppression of women is not in order to make them feel weak, but based on sexiest, assumption of their weakness Thus in add to brutalized women are often unable to find autonomy or Jobs instead being controlled by men and often sexually violated.</p>

		
		 <p> Women area also subjected to men and were not respected we see this when coobe commands Baaba to love Effie, also when the women in the dungeons were discussing their husbands and one of the women brought up that her husband forced her to have sex without even washing the dungeons smells of feaces and death of him.</p>

		<p>Women are also used as commodities we see these when Babaa marry off Effia to James Collins due to money, we also see these through Esi who is sold to slavery while today women have become educated hence not controlled by men domination like in the past.</p>

		<p>Women must deal with forced marriage, absent fathers, and difficulty finding jobs due largely to their gender. We see these through Effia who is forced to marry a white man because he will bring money the family. .</p>

		<p>Women in the novel are not allowed to move about like men about ie like effie sheused to remain inthe castle </p>
		</p> 
		<p>Nowadays women are not perfectly in their role.  
The position of women in the society, and,  particularly, 
in  relation  to  man,  has  had  over the  millennia  many 
facets.  
And now there seems to be a semblance of equality but 
is fictitious.  
Constraints  of  a  much  too  close  past,  are  too  deeply 
rooted.  Women  find  themselves  suspended  between 
the  real  self  consciousness  and  the  conditioning  of  a 
society  that  wants  women  adhering  to the  idea  that 
this society has made of them.  
It is a situation of great confusion.  
The  messages  of the  media  paint  a  picture  of the 
female  stereotype  and  out  of the  reality,  and  the 
woman while is trying to imitate these stereotypes built for the needof market is oozing her essence
