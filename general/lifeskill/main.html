	<p>Sun rays shone on her eyes that is when reality hit her. All the thought of him their marriage come back. She thought it was a bad dream but turns out it was never a dream, it was reality that will always hurt her. Amanda remembers all her life she has dreamt of falling in love. Marrying a man who she had fallen in love for seven years. How could the world be so cruel to her, with all the years that she had invested in their relationship?</p>
  <p>  The planned wedding, the arrangement was so real that she couldnâ€™t believe her best friend Emma could be having an affair with the love of her life. When she knew how she felt for him all those years. The pain, betrayal was present in her eyes, she could not speak or talk about the failed relationship she had just some hours before her wedding. What she supposed to do? Go gain back the love of her life?</p>
   <p> Amanda never thought how to move on, out of this relationship. She never had the dream of losing her best friend to a man that she falls in love with. It was the bitter truth that she had to face it no matter what. She decided to go on a vacation to have peace of mind. She booked a plane and left the country.</p>
<p>She arrives at her destination at 5.00pm it was a cool environment. Amanda mind felt like it has no burden around it .she had a great peace that surrounds the aura. She could only think of how peaceful it felt to be in a silent and peaceful environment. The site of the ocean was beautiful, it was able to speak itself about nature. The main question was she really happy?</p>
