		The environment where there is cool air, rain, mountains trees that gives joy and laughter. We all appreciate what we love. Nature appreciate the things we love, plants, ice, hills, river, ocean, Nature is a natural surrounding around us. It gives us the passion and the love to live among beautiful sand beaches and sandstorm and other things that impress us.</p>
<p>Though people have deserted the idea of taking care of nature it our own idea and creativity that will give us the impression of healthy leaving .we can decide to destroy our own idea of nature and it will give us our own destruction. Everything related to nature is powerful in their own way.it can give us the powerful vibe of creativity, love, wonderful  Gods work and the powerful work it can do.</p>

   <p> We choose to do what we like with the environment that surrounds us. The human has now decided to destroy what we have a making the climate to change giving us the harsh condition that damages us individually. The global warming happening could have been avoided if the people around us could have avoided to damage of the environment by use of fuel, chemicals and other destructions e.g. cutting of natural forest.</p>

<p>It has always fascinated me on how we can do thing a yet different dimension with the cooperation of the nature that we live in. We can all unite to build it together or destroy it and for it to destroy us altogether. Nature can give us the opportunity to appreciate and in return, it will give us feedback for our own actions.it may sound like am saying things in a weird way but that is the truth and the main reason as to why we like to destroy what gives us the vibe and the need to appreciate the environment that we are leaving in .letâ€™s take for example how we make effort in destroying the environment is the same way we it destroy us by global warming and the change in climate.</p>
<p>Many counties experience a change in climate and this has led to food insecurities, the danger of heavy sand storm destroying things. Some countries have experienced an extreme climate change that the sun is too hot it destroys cars and building. The environment gives us O2,  and I return we give out CO2 to plants.
My main question is are we able to change our way and give equally proposition to the environment?</p>
