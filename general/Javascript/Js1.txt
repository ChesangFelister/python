undefined means “no value”. Uninitialized variables are undefined:
    > var foo;
    undefined
If you read a non-existant property, you also get undefined:
    > obj.foo
    undefined
Missing parameters are undefined, too:
    > f()
    undefined
null means “no object”. 
It is used as a non-value when an object is expected (parameters, last in a chain of objects, etc.).
